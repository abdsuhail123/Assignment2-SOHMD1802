	// ======== Random Generators ========

	// This method returns names of monsters. 
	// The type of monster is determined by the difficulty of the location
	// we can use the difficulty as an index to get a monster from the list
	// Difficulty is locked from 0 to 6. total 18 difficulty names
	// This is a little loose, there are probably better ways to map this but I am dealing with 
	// uncertainty by contraining both the input and selected (calculated) indexes manually.

		// Add some random noise. The difficulty should be 'close' to where it actually will be but might be higher
